Hi, my name is Jordan Covarrubias, but I go by the alias AuraFly on different online communities and projects.
I have been passionate about technology ever since 1990 when my father brought home a Tandy 1000 and we installed and played lemmings off of floppy disks. Since then I have been fascinated with computers, the technology they rely on, and IT in general. Through my younger years I spent most of my time learning to build PCs and how their components work, then in high school I began network technology studies with the cisco academy.
After graduation I began my studies with a major in Computer Science. Since then I have been following a career focused on network technology and currently work as a Senior Network Manager directing two very skilled international teams! I am now working hard to expand my skillset into a more creative field and looking to take my first steps as a programmer through the Coding Program with the University of Denver.
